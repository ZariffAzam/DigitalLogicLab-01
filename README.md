# DigitalLogicLab-01
Let's make digital circuits!!

  The basis of every electronic device are digital circuits. In this lab session, I’ve gained practical experience making digital circuits consisting of AND-gates, OR-gates and INVERTER-gates, all done using the ETS-5000, a digital training system.
